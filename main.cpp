/*
    CSCI 2270 Final Project
    Ksenia Lepikhina and Lindsay Walton
*/

/*
 * Kian Tanner - changes made:
 * Added code to make yes or no answers lower case so that user may enter "Yes" or "No"
 * Added code to check if user said not my animal but later said it was
 * Added code to disallow any answer but yes or no for what is the answer to a new question
 * Created destructor mem leaks reduced from 219 bytes to 4 bytes (tested with valgrind)
 * Deleted pointer in count animals and count questions, now no memory leaks!! YAY!!
 * Loading works, before, every line was marked as an animal
 * Loading now doesn't leak memory
 * No memory leaks at all (tested with valgrind)
